  <h3 align="center">Descope Terraform Provider</h3>

  <p align="center">
    Community Terraform provider for Descope, based on the official upstream provider
  </p>

## About

Use the Descope Terraform Provider to manage your [Descope](https://www.descope.com) project
using Terraform configuration files.

* Modify project settings and authentication methods.
* Create connectors, roles, permissions, applications and other entities.
* Use custom themes and flows created in the Descope console.
* Reference entities from one another so they're created in the right order.

<br/>

## Getting Started

This revision adopts upstream’s standalone resource schemas and makes breaking changes to the fork.
Every project-scoped resource takes its own `project_id`. The old `sso_application`, `third_party_application`,
and `outbound_application` resources are replaced by `oidc_app` / `saml_app`, `inbound_app`, and `outbound_app`.
See the [M2M guide](docs/guides/m2m.md) for access keys, custom claims, and token configuration.

### Requirements

-   The [Terraform CLI](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install) installed.
-   A pro or enterprise tier license for your Descope company.
-   A valid management key for your Descope company. You can create one in the
    [Company section](https://app.descope.com/settings/company) of the Descope console.

### Usage

Declare the provider in your configuration and `terraform init` will automatically fetch and install the provider
for you from the [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io):

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    descope = {
      source = "jamescrowley321/descope"
    }
  }
}
```

Configure the Descope provider with the management key as explained above and declare
a `descope_project` resource to create a new project for use with Terraform:

```hcl
provider "descope" {
  management_key = "K..."
}

resource "descope_project" "my_project" {
  name = "My Project"
}
```

Run `terraform plan` to ensure everything works, and then `terraform apply` if you want the project to actually
be created.

The `descope_project` resource manages the project itself and little else. Everything inside the project, from
authentication methods to roles, connectors and flows, is a separate resource that points back at it with a
`project_id` attribute. The examples below all assume the `my_project` resource declared above.

### Existing Projects

To start managing a project that already exists, use the [tfexport](tools/tfexport) tool to generate its
configuration, along with `import` blocks that adopt its entities into your Terraform state.

<br/>

## Examples

### Machine-to-machine authentication

Use `descope_access_key` for service identities, `descope_jwt_template` with `type = "key"` for token claims,
and `descope_session_settings.access_key_jwt_template` to select the template. JSON attributes use `jsonencode`.
See the complete [M2M example](examples/m2m/main.tf) and [guide](docs/guides/m2m.md).

The fork retains `descope_tenant`, tenant SSO (`descope_sso`), tenant-scoped roles (`descope_role.tenant_id`),
and the project, password-settings, project-export, and FGA-check data sources. Project snapshots and `tfexport`
cover project configuration; tenants and their SSO configurations are outside that export.

### Settings

Override the default values for specified project settings, in this case the session settings:

```hcl
resource "descope_session_settings" "my_settings" {
  project_id = descope_project.my_project.id

  refresh_token_expiration = "3 weeks"
  enable_inactivity = true
  inactivity_time = "1 hour"
}
```

The other settings resources work the same way, such as `descope_project_settings` for domains and security,
`descope_invite_settings` for user invitations, and `descope_otp_settings`, `descope_password_settings` and
the rest for the authentication methods.

### Authorization

Configure roles and permissions for users in the project. Roles refer to permissions by name, so use the `name`
attribute of the permission resources rather than hardcoding the names, and Terraform will know to create the
permissions first:

```hcl
resource "descope_permission" "build_apps" {
  project_id = descope_project.my_project.id
  name = "build-apps"
  description = "Allowed to build and sign applications"
}

resource "descope_permission" "upload_builds" {
  project_id = descope_project.my_project.id
  name = "upload-builds"
  description = "Allowed to upload new releases"
}

resource "descope_permission" "install_builds" {
  project_id = descope_project.my_project.id
  name = "install-builds"
  description = "Allowed to install beta releases"
}

resource "descope_role" "app_developer" {
  project_id = descope_project.my_project.id
  name = "App Developer"
  description = "Builds apps and uploads new beta builds"
  permissions = [
    descope_permission.build_apps.name,
    descope_permission.upload_builds.name,
    descope_permission.install_builds.name,
  ]
}

resource "descope_role" "app_tester" {
  project_id = descope_project.my_project.id
  name = "App Tester"
  description = "Installs and tests beta releases"
  permissions = [descope_permission.install_builds.name]
}
```

### Connectors and Flows

Setup a flow called `sign-up-or-in` by creating it in the Descope console in a development
project and exporting it as a `.json` file. Any entities the flow relies on need to be in the
plan as well, so in this example we also configure an HTTP connector with the expected name
`User Check` that the flow expects to be able to make use of. The names in the flow data are
matched against the entities in the project when the flow is imported, and nothing resolves them
again afterwards, so the connector has to exist by then and `depends_on` is what guarantees it.

```hcl
resource "descope_flow" "sign_up_or_in" {
  project_id = descope_project.my_project.id
  flow_id = "sign-up-or-in"
  data = file("flows/sign-up-or-in.json")

  depends_on = [descope_http_connector.user_check]
}

resource "descope_http_connector" "user_check" {
  project_id = descope_project.my_project.id
  name = "User Check"
  description = "A connector for checking if a new user is allowed to sign up"
  base_url = "https://example.com"

  authentication = {
    bearer_token = "<secret>"
  }
}
```

There's a resource for every connector type, named after the connector itself, so an SMTP connector is
a `descope_smtp_connector`, a Datadog connector is a `descope_datadog_connector`, and so on.

## Development

See the [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) file for the development commands, code generation rules, and conventions used in
this repository.

### Setup

Clone the repository and run `make dev` to prepare your local environment for development. This will ensure
you have the requisite `go` compiler, build and install the Descope Terraform Provider binary to `$GOPATH/bin`,
and create a `~/.terraformrc` override file to instruct `terraform` to use the local provider binary instead
of loading it from the Terraform registry.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jamescrowley321/terraform-provider-descope
cd terraform-provider-descope
make dev
```

### Build and Test

After making changes to source files, run `make install` to rebuild and install the provider. You can also run
the acceptance tests to ensure the provider works as expected.

```bash
# runs all unit and acceptance tests
make testacc

# or, to run all tests and compute code coverage
make testcoverage

# rebuild and install the provider
make install
```

## Upstream relationship

This fork tracks [descope/terraform-provider-descope](https://github.com/descope/terraform-provider-descope).
Shared resources and the CRUD framework follow upstream; tenant features and M2M regression fixes remain local
until accepted upstream. Contributions to this fork go to this repository. Retirement remains a separate decision.
