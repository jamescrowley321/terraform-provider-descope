# Quickstart

This guide walks you through setting up the Descope Terraform Provider and creating your first managed project.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

1. **Terraform CLI** – [Install Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install)
2. **Descope Pro or Enterprise account** – The Terraform provider requires a paid plan
3. **A Management Key** – Create one in [Company Settings](https://app.descope.com/settings/company) in the Descope console. Set the scope to **All Projects** to allow creating new projects.

## Step 1: Configure the Provider

Create a new directory for your Terraform configuration:

```shell
mkdir descope-terraform && cd descope-terraform
```

Create `main.tf` with the provider declaration:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    descope = {
      source = "descope/descope"
      version = "~> 0.3"
    }
  }
}

provider "descope" {}
```

Set your management key as an environment variable to avoid hardcoding it:

```shell
export DESCOPE_MANAGEMENT_KEY="K2..."
```

Run `terraform init` to download the provider:

```shell
terraform init
```

## Step 2: Create a Project

Add a project resource to `main.tf`:

```hcl
resource "descope_project" "myapp" {
  name = "my-app"
  tags = ["development"]
}
```

Preview the changes:

```shell
terraform plan
```

Apply them:

```shell
terraform apply
```

Your new Descope project will appear in the [Descope console](https://app.descope.com) within seconds.

## Step 3: Configure Authentication

Extend your project resource with the authentication methods your app will use. This example enables Magic Link and Password:

```hcl
resource "descope_project" "myapp" {
  name = "my-app"

  authentication = {
    magic_link = {
      expiration_time = "1 hour"
    }
    password = {
      min_length    = 10
      lock          = true
      lock_attempts = 5
    }
  }
}
```

Run `terraform apply` to push the updated configuration.

## Step 4: Add Roles and Permissions

Configure RBAC to control what authenticated users can do in your application:

```hcl
resource "descope_project" "myapp" {
  name = "my-app"

  authentication = {
    magic_link = {
      expiration_time = "1 hour"
    }
  }

  authorization = {
    permissions = [
      { name = "read:data" },
      { name = "write:data" },
    ]
    roles = [
      {
        name        = "viewer"
        permissions = ["read:data"]
      },
      {
        name        = "editor"
        permissions = ["read:data", "write:data"]
      },
    ]
  }
}
```

## Step 5: Load Authentication Flows

If you've designed custom flows in the Descope console, you can export them and load them via Terraform:

1. In the Descope console, go to **Authentication Flows**
2. Open the flow you want to manage, click the export button, and save the JSON file (e.g., `flows/sign-up-or-in.json`)
3. Reference the file in your configuration:

```hcl
resource "descope_project" "myapp" {
  name = "my-app"

  flows = {
    "sign-up-or-in" = {
      data = file("${path.module}/flows/sign-up-or-in.json")
    }
  }
}
```
